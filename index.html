<h1> <strong> Century vs Whitney Var. Boys Basketball</strong></h1>
<h2> Game Summary and Highlights</h2>
<p> Whitney came out strong and with intensity.</p>
<p> Century, however, was a weak team compared to Whitney which allowed Whitney to capitalize on Century's uncoordinated defense and slow offensive pace. </p>
<p> Whitney was knocking down shots and getting easy fast breaks while locking in on defense. </p>
<p> By halftime, we built an impressive lead of 28-6 </p>
<p> Although Whitney continued to lead through passing, defense, and consistent shooting, Century began to make their shots and make difficult layups and and-ones. </p>
<p> Despite this, Whitney pulled through by continuing playing with heart and skill ending with a victory and closing the game out with a 54-28 victory. </p>
